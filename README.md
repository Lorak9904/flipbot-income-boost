# 🔁 FlipIt – Fullstack Reselling Automation Tool

**FlipIt** is a smart automation tool that helps users resell second-hand items (like clothes, electronics, or furniture) across marketplaces like **Facebook Marketplace, OLX, and Vinted** — without relying on public APIs.

It uses AI to generate optimized listings from just photos, handles marketplace login with cookies, and posts items automatically.
